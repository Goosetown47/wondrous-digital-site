# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a **Next.js 15 multi-tenant website builder platform**. All active development is in the `/nextjs-app/` directory. The legacy React/Vite app exists but is not in use.

**Production Version:** v0.1.4 
**Development Version:** v0.1.5 
**Deployment Branch:** `nextjs-pagebuilder-core` (NOT master/main!)


## üìã Essential Reading

**IMPORTANT**: Before making any code changes, read these documents in `/nextjs-app/docs/`:

### CORE PRINCIPLES

#### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

#### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

#### Design Principles
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Single Responsibility: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- Fail Fast: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.

#### Updating Documents
- ONLY update the ACTIVE-SPRINT.md file during development. The user will maintain BACKLOG and STATUS-LOG.

#### File and Function Limits
- Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules.
- Functions should be under 50 lines with a single, clear responsibility.
- Classes should be under 100 lines and represent a single concept or entity.
- Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Line length should be max 100 characters


## DOCUMENTATION

### Code Documentation
- Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose
- Complex logic should have inline comments with # Reason: prefix
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions and examples
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version history

### CONTEXT DOCS
**[PRD Design & Build System](./nextjs-app/docs/PRD%20Design%20%26%20Build%20System.md)** - Product vision, architecture, and implementation phases
**[STARTUP-PROMPT.md](./nextjs-app/docs/prompts/STARTUP-PROMPT.md)** - Quick context for new development sessions

### DEVELOPMENT DOCS
1. **[CODE-CHECKLIST.md](./nextjs-app/docs/OPERATIONS/CODE-CHECKLIST.md)** - This document serves as a **MANDATORY** checklist that must be followed for every feature, fix, or code change. It was created after spending multiple days fixing 452 TypeScript errors, 304+ ESLint errors, and numerous build/deployment issues.
2. **[DEV-LIFECYCLE.md](./nextjs-app/docs/OPERATIONS/DEV-LIFECYCLE.md)** - This is our development lifecycle. This is how we process the items in our active sprint. These steps are **MANDATORY** to complete before a sprint can be finished.
3. **[DEV-TOOLS.md](./nextjs-app/docs/OPERATIONS/DEV-TOOLS.md)** - This document outlines what our platform is, what tools are available, and a guide for what to use, when, and how. It should contain every single command, and Claude user stories on when to use what, mapped to each part of our DEV-LIFECYCLE.


### OPERATIONAL DOCS
#### We are using 4 documents to manage our tasks, in a modified agile development process.
1. **[BACKLOG] (./nextjs-app/docs/BACKLOG.md)** - This is our full list of tasks and things we pull from into our active-sprint. Whenever we have new things to add we put them here. This is arranged in priority sections P1, P2, P Low.
2. **[ACTIVE-SPRINT] (./nextjs-app/docs/ACTIVE-SPRINT.md)** - We pull from our backlog document into our ACTIVE_SPRINT, which maps to a release number. 
3. **[STATUS-LOG] (./nextjs-app/docs/STATUS-LOG.md)** - This is an ongoing log of everything we do across the application, from bug fixes to whatever. The user will update this as we close sprints. Do not update this yourself unless prompted.
4. **[RELEASE NOTES] (.nextjs-app/docs/Release_Notes/)** - This is where we create a release notes for each release. 
  **Release Notes Format**
  Identify which version this is and set up a ‚ÄúRelease Notes‚Äù document add to Release_Notes folder.
    1. Identify which versions dev is on, which version production is on. The Release will be what we are deploying to production.
    2. This will have a list of features added, bugs fixed, etc. 
    3. It should be in a ‚Äúcustomer facing‚Äù format that non technical people can read and understand. It will be public facing information. 
    4. It should NOT contain any critical or sensitive information. Just new features and bug fixes.

# Sprint Process Guide (for reference)

## Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)

  1. [User will] Review BACKLOG.md ‚Üí Pull priority items into ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  2. [User will] Set version number ‚Üí Decide scope (major.minor.patch)
  3. [User will] Move packets ‚Üí Cut H4 sections from BACKLOG to ACTIVE-SPRINT
  4. [User will] Order packets ‚Üí Arrange by priority/dependency


## During Sprint Execution

### Per Packet Workflow:

  1. Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE.md ‚Üí Full/Fast Track/Emergency mode per packet
    - First verify with user what dev mode each packet should use.
    - ACTIVE SPRINT ‚Üí Write in tasks from our LIFECYCLE process as part of the packet tasks.
  2. Update ACTIVE-STATUS.md ‚Üí Log progress after each packet
  3. Check off tasks ‚Üí Mark complete in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  4. [User will] Move to Sprint Backlog ‚Üí When packet done, grab next

### Daily Flow:

  - Start: Check Current Focus in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  - Work: Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE for that packet
  - Discover: Add found issues to appropriate section
  - End: Update ACTIVE-SPRINT with progress

### Sprint Completion

  1. All packets done ‚Üí Verify all tasks checked
  2. Create Release Notes ‚Üí /docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.1.md
  3. [User will] Archive sprint content ‚Üí Copy ACTIVE-SPRINT to STATUS-LOG
  4. [User will] Clear ACTIVE-SPRINT.md ‚Üí Reset for next sprint
  5. [User will] Update version numbers ‚Üí Production/Development in all docs


## Key Rules

  - COMPLETE DEV-LIFECYCLE per packet before moving on
  - DOCUMENT found work immediately
  - NEVER skip DEV-LIFECYCLE steps
  - Always use CODE-CHECKLIST

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

## Multi-Tenant Platform
- Single Next.js application serving thousands of customer websites
- Domain-based routing via middleware
- Deployed on Vercel with automatic SSL for custom domains
- Following the proven architecture of Webflow, Shopify, etc.

## Key Components
1. **Core** - Raw component library from shadcn/ui
2. **Lab** - Internal workspace for creating templates
3. **Library** - Published templates (sections, pages, sites, themes)
4. **Builder** - User-facing drag-and-drop interface
5. **Projects** - Individual customer websites

## üöÄ Deployment Process

**CRITICAL**: Our deployment branch is `nextjs-pagebuilder-core` (NOT master/main!)
- All PRs must target `nextjs-pagebuilder-core`
- Vercel automatically deploys from `nextjs-pagebuilder-core`
- Never create PRs against `master` branch

## üíª Development Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Always work in the `/nextjs-app/` directory!

```bash
cd nextjs-app
```

### Development Server
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidelines

1. **Follow KISS, DRY, and SOLID principles**
2. **No throwaway work** - Everything must be production-ready
3. **Maintain clear separation** between app code and project code
4. **Test thoroughly** before marking tasks complete
5. **Update documentation** as you make changes
- ‚úÖ DO tell me if we're doing something that rubs against the grain for the tech stack we are using. If we're doing something VERY atypical that could cause us headaches down the road, SOUND THE ALARM!
- ‚úÖ Everything we do must be work that is saved and critical to our production environment.
- ‚úÖ DO tell me what you really think. Don't agree with me just to agree. Disagree with me if you disagree.
- ‚úÖ Do review your assumptions
- ‚úÖ DO collaborate with me along the way to test things (anything non-code that I can do, you should ask me to)
- ‚úÖ Do have conversations with me vs defaulting to plans right away
- ‚úÖ DO interview me before responding if needed to clarify missing data or thoughts.


## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don't work in the root `/src/` directory (that's the old React app)
2. Don't create temporary hardcoded examples
3. Don't mix project-level code with app-level code
4. Don't skip updating the task list when completing work
- üö´ Do not be destructive in our build process, meaning our work unless specified, must not break functionality we‚Äôve built.
- üö´ Don't start the project on a new port if the main port isn't working. Verify WHY it isn't working and work to resolve that issue first.
- üö´ Do not mix project level code with app level code. Our application must remain independent from the projects and themes contained within it. Users will be building websites with themes and templates. Our app will use Core components and themes, but the projects being created must be their own independent websites.
- üö´ DO NOT let us spin our wheels trying to solve something over and over. Always step back and look at the macro and micro and think deeply about what we‚Äôre doing.
