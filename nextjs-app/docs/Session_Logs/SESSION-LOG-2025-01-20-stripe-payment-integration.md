# Session Log: 2025-01-20 - Stripe Payment Integration & Testing

## Session Overview
**Date:** January 20, 2025
**Sprint:** v0.1.5 - "Payments, Packages, and Features Oh My"
**Focus:** PACKET 2 - Stripe Integration Testing & Debugging
**Status:** In Progress - Critical Issue Found

## What We Accomplished Today

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed ALL TypeScript & ESLint Errors**
   - Fixed 38 TypeScript errors in test files
   - Resolved 18 ESLint `any` type warnings
   - Fixed 2 unused variable warnings
   - Build now compiles cleanly

2. **Fixed Development Environment Issues**
   - Resolved multiple PM2 instances causing port conflicts
   - Cleared corrupted .next cache
   - Restarted dev server cleanly
   - Fixed webpack routes-manifest.json errors

3. **Configured Branded Email System**
   - Set up Supabase to use Resend SMTP
   - All emails now come from hello@wondrousdigital.com
   - Removed custom email code that was causing client-side env var errors
   - Deleted files:
     - `/src/lib/services/auth-emails.tsx`
     - `/src/emails/verification.tsx`

4. **Fixed Cold Visitor Webhook Handling**
   - Modified webhook to handle pending account IDs
   - Added logic to look up real account by email for cold visitors
   - Fixed invalid UUID error for pending IDs

5. **Added Visual Tier Confirmation UI**
   - Updated dashboard to show tier badges (FREE/PRO/SCALE/MAX)
   - Added new Billing Status card with subscription info
   - Fixed Account Overview to display tier instead of plan
   - Color-coded tier badges throughout UI

### üîç Critical Issue Discovered

**THE WEBHOOK CANNOT UPDATE THE DATABASE**

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Authentication Problem:**
   - Webhook handler uses `createSupabaseServerClient()` with ANON key
   - Webhooks don't have user authentication/cookies
   - ANON key lacks permission to insert into protected tables
   - Tables affected: `stripe_webhook_logs`, `account_billing_history`, `accounts`

2. **Evidence:**
   - Stripe CLI shows all webhooks returning 200 OK
   - But `stripe_webhook_logs` table is completely empty
   - `account_billing_history` table is empty
   - Account tier remains "FREE" despite successful payment
   - No error messages because inserts fail silently

3. **Why This Happened:**
   - We never created a service role Supabase client
   - The SERVICE_ROLE_KEY exists in .env but is never used
   - All our API routes use ANON key which respects RLS
   - Webhooks need to bypass RLS to act as the system

## Current State of the System

### Database Status:
- **Tier Migration:** Created but may not be fully applied
- **Tables Empty:** stripe_webhook_logs, account_billing_history
- **Account Status:** Shows FREE tier despite MAX payment
- **Stripe Status:** Customer created, subscription active (in Stripe, not our DB)

### Test Account Created:
- **Email:** paksev414@baxidy.com (or whatever test email was used)
- **Account Name:** "DELETE ME" (user entered during testing)
- **Current Tier:** FREE (should be MAX)
- **Stripe Customer:** Created but ID not saved
- **Subscription:** Active in Stripe, not linked in our DB

### Files Modified Today:
1. `/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added tier display
2. `/src/app/(app)/tools/accounts/[id]/components/AccountOverview.tsx` - Fixed tier display
3. `/src/app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` - Added cold visitor handling
4. `/src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx` - Removed custom email code
5. Multiple test files - Fixed TypeScript errors

## What Needs to Be Done (CRITICAL PATH)

### 1. **Create Service Role Client** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```typescript
// Create new file: /src/lib/supabase/service.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

export function createSupabaseServiceClient() {
  return createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!, // This bypasses RLS
    {
      auth: {
        autoRefreshToken: false,
        persistSession: false
      }
    }
  );
}
```

### 2. **Update Webhook Handler**
- Import and use `createSupabaseServiceClient()` instead of `createSupabaseServerClient()`
- Add try/catch with detailed error logging
- Log successful database operations

### 3. **Apply Database Migration**
```bash
cd nextjs-app
npx supabase db push --password 'MsDH6QjUsf6vXD3nCeYkBNiF'
```

### 4. **Add Account Name to Cold Visitor Flow**
- Update `/src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx`
- Add "Company/Account Name" field
- Save it when creating the account

### 5. **Test Complete Flow Again**
- Use new incognito window
- Complete payment with test card
- Verify webhook updates account tier
- Check all tables have data

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Account Name Missing:** Cold visitor flow doesn't collect company name
2. **No Error Visibility:** Webhook errors fail silently
3. **Migration Status Unclear:** Need to verify tier column exists
4. **Dev Server Instability:** .next cache corruption happens frequently

## Testing Checklist for Tomorrow

When you resume testing:

1. [ ] Verify SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is in .env.local
2. [ ] Create service role client
3. [ ] Update webhook to use service role
4. [ ] Apply tier migration if needed
5. [ ] Clear test data from database
6. [ ] Test cold visitor flow end-to-end
7. [ ] Verify webhook logs are saved
8. [ ] Verify account tier is updated
9. [ ] Test invitation flow
10. [ ] Test upgrade flow

## Important Context for Next Session

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_97731da2eecb847caa56fced1707b43fd01280a5f308e5aecc39e585e3719148
```

### Commands to Run:
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Start Stripe webhook listener
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks

# Check migration status
npx supabase migration list --password 'MsDH6QjUsf6vXD3nCeYkBNiF'
```

### Key Files to Review:
1. `/src/app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` - Needs service role client
2. `/src/lib/stripe/utils.ts` - Contains updateAccountTier function
3. `/src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx` - Needs account name field
4. `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Only has ANON client

## Session Summary

We made significant progress on the Stripe integration but discovered a critical authentication issue preventing webhooks from updating the database. The payment flow works, emails are branded, and the UI is ready - but the webhook can't save data due to using the wrong Supabase client.

**The fix is straightforward:** Create and use a service role client for webhooks. This will unblock everything and allow the payment flow to work completely.

User is tired and stopping for the day. Pick up tomorrow with creating the service role client as the first priority.
