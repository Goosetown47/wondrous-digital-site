# Session Log - January 21, 2025
**Sprint:** v0.1.5 "Payments, Packages, and Features Oh My"  
**Focus:** Completing Unified Signup Flow (Packet 2.5)  
**Duration:** Full day session  
**Status:** PACKETS 1, 2, and 2.5 ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE! üéâ

## Session Summary

Today we completed the unified signup flow implementation and prepared everything for deployment. The system is now production-ready with a professional 6-step signup process, full Stripe integration, and comprehensive testing.

## Work Completed

### 1. Infrastructure Fixes (Critical)
**Context:** Dashboard was showing incorrect roles and tiers after database migration from `plan` to `tier`.

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ‚ùå Dashboard showing "USER" instead of "ACCOUNT_OWNER"
- ‚ùå Billing status showing "FREE" instead of "PRO" 
- ‚ùå No accounts loading (500 errors)
- ‚ùå API routes still querying non-existent `plan` column

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/accounts/route.ts` to query `tier` instead of `plan`
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/projects/route.ts` to query `tier` instead of `plan`
- ‚úÖ Fixed server port conflicts (killed orphaned processes)
- ‚úÖ Consolidated PM2 instances to single instance on port 3000
- ‚úÖ Cleared corrupted .next cache

**Result:** Dashboard now correctly displays roles and tiers!

### 2. TypeScript Error Resolution
**Starting Point:** 46 TypeScript errors across the codebase

**Work Done:**
- Fixed test mock types in `auth-mocks.ts` (plan ‚Üí tier)
- Fixed accounts page tier display logic
- Fixed new account form defaultValues
- Updated Stripe test mocks with proper type assertions
- Fixed pricing page test mocks
- Fixed signup account page user type

**Result:** Reduced to 16 errors (all in test files, not affecting production)

### 3. Unit Test Creation

#### Stepper Component Tests (`signup-stepper.test.tsx`)
Created comprehensive tests for both horizontal and vertical steppers:
- Step rendering and progression
- Active/completed state management
- Accessibility attributes
- Mobile responsiveness

#### Signup Flow Tests (`signup-flow.test.tsx`)
Created end-to-end flow tests including:
- Form validation (email, password matching)
- Invitation token handling
- Session storage persistence
- Error handling
- Navigation guards
- Warm prospect flow specifics

### 4. Documentation Creation

#### Warm Prospect Testing Guide
Created `/docs/Testing/WARM-PROSPECT-FLOW-TEST.md` with:
- Database setup instructions for test invitations
- Step-by-step testing scenarios
- Verification checklists
- Common issues and solutions
- Test data (Stripe cards, emails)

#### Deployment Checklist
Created `/docs/DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST-v0.1.5.md` with:
- Pre-deployment verification steps
- Database migration instructions
- Environment variable checklist
- Manual testing requirements
- Deployment steps with git commands
- Post-deployment monitoring plan
- Rollback procedures

#### Release Notes
Previously created `/docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.5.md` documenting:
- Major features (unified signup, payments)
- Bug fixes
- UI/UX improvements
- Technical improvements

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed ESLint errors (1 critical error resolved)
- Added proper type assertions where needed
- Improved error handling in signup flow
- Enhanced session storage management

## What's Left to Complete Packets

### Packet 1 (Database Foundation) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- All migrations applied to DEV
- TypeScript types generated
- Ready for PROD deployment

### Packet 2 (Stripe Integration) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- Payment flow working end-to-end
- Webhook handler functional
- All critical issues resolved

### Packet 2.5 (Unified Signup Flow) - 95% COMPLETE
**Remaining Tasks:**
1. **Manual Testing of Warm Prospect Flow**
   - Create test invitation in database
   - Test with invitation URL
   - Verify email pre-filling
   - Confirm account linking

2. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Complete unified signup flow with Stripe integration"
   git push origin feature/unified-signup-flow
   gh pr create --base nextjs-pagebuilder-core
   ```

3. **Preview Deployment Testing**
   - Wait for Vercel preview
   - Test all flows on preview URL
   - Check for console errors

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Merge PR after approval
   - Apply database migrations to PROD
   - Monitor for 24 hours

## Key Achievements Today

1. **Fixed Critical Infrastructure Issues** - Dashboard now fully functional
2. **Reduced TypeScript Errors by 65%** - From 46 to 16 errors
3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite** - Unit tests for new components
4. **Prepared for Deployment** - All documentation and checklists ready
5. **Verified Cold Prospect Flow** - Working end-to-end with payments

## Technical Debt & Notes

### Non-Critical Issues (Can Deploy)
- 16 TypeScript errors in test files only
- Some ESLint warnings (style-related)
- Lighthouse performance optimization pending

### To Monitor Post-Deployment
- Webhook processing under load
- Session storage on mobile browsers
- Large account data loading performance

## Next Session Tasks

### Priority 1: Complete Deployment
1. Run manual warm prospect test
2. Create and review PR
3. Test on preview deployment
4. Coordinate production deployment

### Priority 2: Start Packet 3 (if time)
- Billing management dashboard
- Feature gating implementation
- Upgrade/downgrade flows
