### [PACKET] Feature Tagging System

- [ ] Brainstorm with Claude and write tasks for this

---

### [PACKET] Feature Management System
**Goal:** Create a new page in Tools area that let's me manage which paid tiers get which things.
**Deliverable:** A feature and library content management system
**Notes:** This will enable staff to active set what features are available to each tier dynamically, and as we bring on new features, segment and test them with specific customers.


- [ ] üöÄ New page in tools where we can manage features and library content
  - Should have tabs to segment content like "features" "site templates" "themes" "sections"
  - Within each tab, we should have a grid with the tiers on the top horizontal row and the items on the vertical left column, with a checkbox grid for each row. So for any feature I can check or uncheck it from a specific paid tier/addon and it will enable or disable it for the accounts that are in those tiers automatically/dynamically.

- [ ] Brainstorm with Claude and write tasks for this

---

### [PACKET] Stripe Integration

- [ ] We need to set up the Stripe Payment system and get it integrated into our application (I need help figuring this one out)

## Navigation** v0.2.1 ---------------------------------------- ##
- Navigation System (needs definition)


### [PACKET] Navigation System
**Goal:** Users can create navigation sections and functionality linking their website together.  
**Deliverable:** Fully functioning WYSIWYG editing and config for 
**Notes:** We need to create an industry standard, highly interactive, usable navigation system for customers to be able to connect their websites navigation, perform CRUD on elements, and select from different navigation sections (eventually) that have different complexities of configuration like super drop downs. We need this to work for nav bars, footers, and side nav bar components/sections.

**Feature Task List:**
- [ ] add  

- [ ] üöÄ Navigation System:
  - [ ] üöÄ Design navigation data structure
  - [ ] üöÄ Create navigation menu builder UI

### [PACKET] Canvas Builder Improvements
**Notes:** I want to create an immersive, sleak builder interface that is interactive and really easy to use. I like the way https://www.shadcnblocks.com/blocks structures their blocks and how you can change the format using grid, list, masonry modes. I like that you can click into the block and see it fully. I want to put something like this in a drawer that you can open and close and select to add sections to your pages. I'd like a sidebar on the right side that has a representation of each of the sections on the page that you can hover over to drag and drop, delete, change, lock etc. This is an abstraction of what's on the page for ease of use. Instead of scrolling up and down to drag things which can be clumsy you can just do it in the sidebar. Users should be able to grab an element from the drawer and drag it into place on the sidebar, and then it appears in the canvas and on the sidebar.

# Sprint Process Guide (for reference)

## Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)

  1. [User will] Review BACKLOG.md ‚Üí Pull priority items into ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  2. [User will] Set version number ‚Üí Decide scope (major.minor.patch)
  3. [User will] Move packets ‚Üí Cut H4 sections from BACKLOG to ACTIVE-SPRINT
  4. [User will] Order packets ‚Üí Arrange by priority/dependency


## During Sprint Execution

### Per Packet Workflow:

  1. Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE.md ‚Üí Full/Fast Track/Emergency mode per packet
  2. As you discover issues ‚Üí Add to "Found Work" section:
    - Critical ‚Üí Must fix in current version
    - Non-Critical ‚Üí Defer to next version
    - Tech Debt ‚Üí Document for future
  3. Update ACTIVE-STATUS.md ‚Üí Log progress after each packet
  4. Check off tasks ‚Üí Mark complete in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  5. [User will] Move to Sprint Backlog ‚Üí When packet done, grab next

### Daily Flow:

  - Start: Check Current Focus in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  - Work: Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE for that packet
  - Discover: Add found issues to appropriate section
  - End: Update ACTIVE-SPRINT with progress

### Sprint Completion

  1. All packets done ‚Üí Verify all tasks checked
  2. Create Release Notes ‚Üí /docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.1.md
  3. [User will] Archive sprint content ‚Üí Copy ACTIVE-SPRINT to STATUS-LOG
  4. [User will] Clear ACTIVE-SPRINT.md ‚Üí Reset for next sprint
  5. [User will] Update version numbers ‚Üí Production/Development in all docs


## Key Rules

  - COMPLETE DEV-LIFECYCLE per packet before moving on
  - DOCUMENT found work immediately
  - NEVER skip DEV-LIFECYCLE steps
  - Always use CODE-CHECKLIST
