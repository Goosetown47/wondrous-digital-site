# ACTIVE SPRINT
## ------------------------------------------------ ##

## OVERVIEW

**Production Version:** v0.1.4 
**Development Version:** v0.1.5


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

**Onboarding Clean Up**
We need to streamline and clean up our onboarding processes so they feel nice for our different types of customers. Right now we have inconsistency and chaotic sign up flows. Some people get their profile settings, some get account settings. We need a cohesive experience for sign ups that shows their progress as they complete the steps to onboard using a stepper. We need to ensure that each customer type (cold prospect, warm prospect, existing) has a consistent onboarding experience.

Let's brainstorm the best UX order for each of these. Below are loose thoughts.
- [ ] Create unified onboarding experience that recognizes the type of customer it is an serves the correct pages as part of the "stepper" (which shows how many steps there are, and what step your on currently, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure that cold customers: Create a login, confirm the login, pay, see payment confirmation, finish setting up the account, set up their profile, and see a welcome page with next steps on the dashboard.
- [ ] Ensure warm customers are greeted, can set up a login, confirm it, pay, see payment confirmation, finalize setting up their account and profile, then be greeted with a welcome and next steps in their dashboard.

2. Stripe CLI webhook testing
3. End-to-end payment flow testing

**Next Steps:**
Once testing is complete, proceed to PACKET 3: Billing Management & Feature Gating.

### January 20, 2025 - PACKET 2 Testing & Critical Issue Found

**Testing Progress:**
1. ✅ Set up Stripe CLI webhook forwarding
2. ✅ Fixed development environment issues (PM2 conflicts, .next cache corruption)
3. ✅ Configured branded emails via Supabase SMTP (hello@wondrousdigital.com)
4. ✅ Fixed cold visitor webhook handling (pending account ID issue)
5. ✅ Added visual tier confirmation to dashboard
6. ✅ Successfully completed payment flow through Stripe

**🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:**
The webhook handler CANNOT write to the database. Root cause:
- Webhook uses `createSupabaseServerClient()` with ANON key
- Webhooks don't have user authentication/cookies
- ANON key lacks permission to insert into protected tables
- Tables affected: `stripe_webhook_logs`, `account_billing_history`, `accounts`
- Result: Tier never updates despite successful payment

**Evidence:**
- Stripe CLI shows all webhooks returning 200 OK
- `stripe_webhook_logs` table is empty (webhook can't insert)
- `account_billing_history` table is empty  
- Account tier remains "FREE" despite MAX tier payment
- No errors shown because database inserts fail silently

**🔧 REQUIRED FIX (HIGH PRIORITY):**
1. Create `/lib/supabase/service.ts` with SERVICE_ROLE client
2. Update webhook handler to use service role client
3. Add proper error logging to catch database failures
4. Apply database migration if not already applied
5. Add "Company Name" field to cold visitor profile setup

**Additional Issues Found:**
- Dev server frequently corrupts .next cache (requires clearing)
- Cold visitor flow doesn't collect company/account name
- No visibility into webhook processing errors

See `/docs/Session_Logs/SESSION-LOG-2025-01-20-stripe-payment-integration.md` for full details.

**Next Steps:**
Fix webhook authentication issue before continuing with PACKET 2 testing.

### August 20, 2025 - PACKET 2.5 Planning

**Created PACKET 2.5: Unified Signup Flow Redesign**

After testing the current payment flow, identified critical UX issues:
- Payment-first approach creates high friction
- Redundant data entry (users enter info multiple times)  
- No clear progress indicators
- Fragmented paths for cold vs warm customers

Redesigning to industry-standard flow:
1. Sign up with email/password
2. Confirm email
3. Enter business details (create account)
4. Enter personal details
5. Select plan and pay
6. Success with confetti → Dashboard

Key improvements:
- Progressive disclosure with stepper component
- Trust-building messaging at each step
- Account created BEFORE payment (lead capture)
- Unified flow for all customer types
- Session persistence for abandoned signups

Using FULL FEATURE mode for this comprehensive redesign.
User will handle manual testing and dev server management.

### August 20, 2025 - PACKET 2.5 Infrastructure & API Fixes

**Context:**
After database migration removed `plan` column in favor of `tier`, discovered API routes were still querying the non-existent column, causing critical dashboard failures.

**Issues Discovered:**
1. ❌ Dashboard showing "USER" instead of "ACCOUNT_OWNER" role
2. ❌ Billing status showing "FREE" instead of "PRO" tier
3. ❌ No accounts loading (500 errors from API)
4. ❌ Console error: "column accounts.plan does not exist"
5. ❌ Multiple PM2 instances running on different ports
6. ❌ Orphaned Next.js process blocking port 3000
7. ❌ Corrupted .next cache causing 404 errors

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Database migration successfully removed `plan` column
- API routes `/api/accounts/route.ts` and `/api/projects/route.ts` still querying for `plan`
- This caused 500 errors, preventing account data from loading
- Without account data, role and tier display defaulted to incorrect values

**Fixes Implemented:**
1. ✅ Updated `/api/accounts/route.ts`:
   - Changed admin/staff query from `plan` to `tier` (line 65)
   - Changed regular user query from `plan` to `tier` (lines 73-88)
   - Added subscription-related fields to queries

2. ✅ Updated `/api/projects/route.ts`:
   - Changed accounts join from `plan` to `tier` (line 74)

3. ✅ Server Management:
   - Killed orphaned Next.js process using port 3000
   - Cleaned up multiple PM2 instances (`pm2 delete all`)
   - Started single PM2 instance on correct port
   - Cleared corrupted .next cache

**Results:**
✅ Dashboard now correctly shows "ACCOUNT_OWNER" role in sidebar
✅ Billing section displays "PRO" tier with "Active" status
✅ All accounts loading successfully
✅ No API errors in console
✅ Server running cleanly on port 3000

**Key Learnings:**
- Database migrations must be followed by comprehensive API updates
- Always check for orphaned processes when experiencing port conflicts
- PM2 can create multiple instances if not managed properly
- .next cache corruption can cause mysterious 404 errors

**Next Steps:**
With infrastructure issues resolved, can now proceed with implementing the unified signup flow UI components and pages.
