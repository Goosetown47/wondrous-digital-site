## PACKETS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##


#### [Packet] Service Layer & API Updates
**Goal:** Complete account-aware implementation gaps and fix critical infrastructure  
**Deliverable:** Fully account-aware service layer with proper audit logging
**Note:** Much of the foundation is already built - we're filling in gaps and completing partial implementations

##### Critical Infrastructure Fix

Created the Missing Audit Logs Table 📊
- [x] 🪲 Create audit_logs table migration (currently missing but referenced in code!)
  - [x] 🪲 Design table schema based on existing audit service usage
  - [x] 🪲 Create migration file with proper indexes
  - [x] 🪲 Test audit logging works after table creation

  The Problem: Your code was trying to write to an audit_logs table that didn't
  exist! Every time someone created a project, updated a page, or changed
  settings, the code tried to log it but silently failed.

  What I Did:
  - Created a proper audit_logs table in your database
  - Added security policies so users can only see logs for their own accounts
  - Platform admins can see everything (for support/debugging)

  Why It's Better:
  - You now have a complete history of who did what and when
  - Great for security compliance (some customers require this)
  - Helps with debugging ("Why did this project disappear?")
  - Enables features like "Activity Feed" for users


##### Service Layer Account Context Gaps


**Update Pages service with full account context**
The Problem: The Pages service was partially trusting that pages wouldn't be
accessed across accounts, but it wasn't actively checking. It's like having
apartment doors that usually stay locked but don't actually verify your key.

The Key Addition - verifyProjectAccess():
  This function checks:
  1. Is the user a platform admin? (They can see everything)
  2. Is the user a member of the account that owns this project?
  3. If neither, throw "Access Denied"

  - [ ] 🚀 Update all services to use standard errors
- [ ] 🚀 Add account not found error handling
  - [ ] 🚀 Handle cases where account doesn't exist
  - [ ] 🚀 Provide helpful error messages
- [ ] 🚀 Ensure consistent error messages across all services
  - [ ] 🚀 Audit all error returns
  - [ ] 🚀 Create error message constants

##### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] 🚀 Create mock account context helpers
  - [ ] 🚀 Build test utilities for mocking account state
  - [ ] 🚀 Create fixtures for different account scenarios
- [ ] 🚀 Add permission testing utilities
  - [ ] 🚀 Helper functions to test permission boundaries
  - [ ] 🚀 Test cases for cross-account access attempts

##### Already Completed (Found During Scan)
- ✅ useAccount(), useAccountProjects(), useAccountUsers() hooks exist
- ✅ Permission system with hasPermission() and requirePermission()
- ✅ Account switching functionality
- ✅ Projects service has account filtering
- ✅ Basic audit logging implementation (just needs table)

#### [Packet] Database Isolation (Supabase) 
**Goal:** Create proper isolation for our production and development databases. 
**Notes:** We currently have one single database powering development and production, which is not ideal and can cause serious issues down the road. We need to have both a development and production database that are completely in sync structurally, but utilize their own content. We need proper processes in place to handle this complexity.

##### Initial Planning & Assessment
- [ ] 📌 Document current database structure and dependencies
- [ ] 📌 Audit all environment variables across dev and production
- [ ] 📌 Create backup of current production database
- [ ] 📌 Map out all services that connect to the database
- [ ] 📌 Identify any hardcoded database connections

##### Supabase Project Setup
- [ ] ⚙️ Create new Supabase project for production
- [ ] ⚙️ Configure production project settings to match current setup
- [ ] ⚙️ Set up production authentication providers
- [ ] ⚙️ Configure production RLS policies
- [ ] ⚙️ Set up production Edge Functions (if any)

##### Migration Strategy Development
- [ ] 📌 Create migration script to copy schema from dev to prod
- [ ] 📌 Document which tables need data migration vs. fresh start
- [ ] 📌 Create data migration plan for essential data (accounts, users, etc.)
- [ ] 📌 Plan cutover strategy with minimal downtime
- [ ] 📌 Create rollback plan in case of issues

##### Environment Configuration
- [ ] ⚙️ Update .env.local with development database credentials
- [ ] ⚙️ Create .env.production with production database credentials
- [ ] ⚙️ Update Vercel environment variables for production
- [ ] ⚙️ Create environment switching mechanism for local development
- [ ] ⚙️ Update all service configurations to use correct env vars

##### Schema Synchronization Process
- [ ] 🚀 Set up migration tracking system (version control)
- [ ] 🚀 Create CI/CD pipeline for automatic migration deployment
- [ ] 🚀 Implement pre-deployment migration validation
- [ ] 🚀 Create migration rollback procedures
- [ ] 🚀 Document migration naming conventions and process

##### Data Management Procedures
- [ ] 📌 Create seed data scripts for development
- [ ] 📌 Implement data anonymization for dev database
- [ ] 📌 Set up regular production → dev sync process (schema only)
- [ ] 📌 Create data cleanup scripts for development
- [ ] 📌 Document data refresh procedures

##### Testing & Validation
- [ ] ⚗️ Test all migrations on development first
- [ ] ⚗️ Verify RLS policies work identically in both environments
- [ ] ⚗️ Test authentication flows in both environments
- [ ] ⚗️ Validate all API endpoints with new database
- [ ] ⚗️ Performance test with production-like data volume

##### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] 🚀 Set up database monitoring for both environments
- [ ] 🚀 Configure backup schedules for production
- [ ] 🚀 Implement database health checks
- [ ] 🚀 Create alerts for schema drift detection
- [ ] 🚀 Set up query performance monitoring

##### Documentation & Training
- [ ] 📌 Document environment setup for new developers
- [ ] 📌 Create runbook for common database operations
- [ ] 📌 Document emergency procedures
- [ ] 📌 Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] 📌 Update CLAUDE.md with new database setup

## Sprint Process Guide

### Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)

  1. Review BACKLOG.md → Pull priority items into ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  2. Set version number → Decide scope (major.minor.patch)
  3. Move packets → Cut H4 sections from BACKLOG to ACTIVE-SPRINT
  4. Order packets → Arrange by priority/dependency


### During Sprint Execution

#### Per Packet Workflow:

  1. Move packet to Current Focus → Work on one packet at a time
  2. Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE.md → Full/Fast Track/Emergency mode per packet
  3. As you discover issues → Add to "Found Work" section:
    - Critical → Must fix in current version
    - Non-Critical → Defer to next version
    - Tech Debt → Document for future
  4. Update STATUS-LOG.md → Log progress after each packet
  5. Check off tasks → Mark complete in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  6. Move to Sprint Backlog → When packet done, grab next

#### Daily Flow:

  - Start: Check Current Focus in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  - Work: Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE for that packet
  - Discover: Add found issues to appropriate section
  - End: Update STATUS-LOG with progress

#### Sprint Completion

  1. All packets done → Verify all tasks checked
  2. Create Release Notes → /docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.1.md
  3. Archive sprint content → Copy ACTIVE-SPRINT to STATUS-LOG
  4. Clear ACTIVE-SPRINT.md → Reset for next sprint
  5. Update version numbers → Production/Development in all docs


### Key Rules

  - ONE packet in Current Focus at a time
  - COMPLETE DEV-LIFECYCLE per packet before moving on
  - DOCUMENT found work immediately
  - UPDATE STATUS-LOG per packet completion
  - NEVER skip DEV-LIFECYCLE steps
