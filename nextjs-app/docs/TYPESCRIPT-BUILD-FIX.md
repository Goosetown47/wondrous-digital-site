#### 4.2 Remaining Issues
- [ ] Resend email API type mismatch
  - CreateEmailOptions interface doesn't match our usage
  - Need to investigate exact type requirements

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Verification & Testing (PENDING)

#### 5.1 Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes completely
- [ ] Production build works locally

#### 5.2 Runtime Testing
- [ ] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Core functionality works (auth, projects, builder)
- [ ] All integrated libraries function correctly

#### 5.3 Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Vercel deployment compatibility verified
- [ ] Environment variables properly typed
- [ ] Production performance acceptable

## Error Categories & Fixes

### Category A: Missing Type Definitions
**Impact**: High (blocks build)  
**Effort**: Low (install packages)  
**Priority**: Phase 1

### Category B: Application Interface Mismatches
**Impact**: High (runtime errors)  
**Effort**: Medium (refactor types)  
**Priority**: Phase 2

### Category C: Library Integration Issues
**Impact**: Medium (feature-specific)  
**Effort**: Medium (configuration)  
**Priority**: Phase 3

### Category D: Build Tool Configuration
**Impact**: Low (developer experience)  
**Effort**: Low (config changes)  
**Priority**: Phase 4

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase has a git commit for safe rollback
- Stash changes before major modifications
- Test core functionality after each phase
- Maintain backup branch if needed

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors in build
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Core application functionality works
- [ ] Successful Vercel deployment
- [ ] No runtime type errors in production

## Notes & Lessons Learned
- Next.js 15 async params pattern was critical for build success
- ESLint pre-commit hooks caught type safety issues early
- Systematic approach prevents regression of fixed errors
- ThemeVariables flat structure simplifies color management
- Type guards are essential for union type property access
- Supabase server client requires await in Next.js 15

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Final Cleanup (nearly complete)  
**Next Action**: Fix Resend email API type mismatch (final 1-2 errors)

## Error Type Breakdown (for reference)
- **TS2339 (Property does not exist)**: 98 errors (62%)
- **TS2322 (Type assignment mismatch)**: 19 errors (12%)
- **TS7006 (Implicit any)**: 8 errors (5%)
- **TS18046 (Unknown type)**: 7 errors (4%)
- **TS2345 (Argument mismatch)**: 6 errors (4%)

## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Lab Editor Architecture Issue**: The lab editor is currently hardcoded to only work with HeroTwoColumn sections. It needs to be refactored to dynamically handle different section types based on the draft.type and draft.component_name.

2. **Type Union Challenges**: Many errors stem from accessing properties on union types (SectionContent | PageContent | SiteContent | ThemeVariables). Proper type guards are needed throughout.

3. **Test Infrastructure**: A large portion of remaining errors (~41%) are in test files, indicating we need to update our test mocking strategy for the new type system.

4. **Progress Tracking**: We've successfully reduced errors by 83% (from 452 to 77) by systematically fixing type definitions and core application interfaces.

5. **ThemeVariables Structure Change**: Discovered that ThemeVariables changed from nested structure (e.g., `colors.primary`) to flat structure (e.g., `primary`). This affected multiple theme-related components.

6. **Next.js 15 Async Patterns**: All API routes now properly await `createSupabaseServerClient()` and handle async params correctly.

7. **Build Blocker Resolved**: The unplugin/rollup type error was preventing production builds. Setting `skipLibCheck: true` resolved this third-party type issue.

8. **Test Mock Architecture**: Proper Supabase mock structure requires separating the client mock from the query builder mock to match the actual chaining API.

9. **Phase 4 Success**: Through systematic fixes of edge cases, type mismatches, and API inconsistencies, we've reduced errors from 77 to just ~2 (99%+ reduction from initial 452 errors!).
