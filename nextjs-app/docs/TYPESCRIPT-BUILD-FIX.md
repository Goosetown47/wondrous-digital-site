- [x] Decision: Accept 1 library error, focus on 428 application errors

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Core Application Type Fixes (IN PROGRESS)

#### 2.1 Fix Interface Mismatches âœ…
- [x] Fixed imports type mismatch (array vs Record) in core-components.ts
- [x] Fixed source enum consistency (removed "third-party" references)
- [x] Standardized component prop interfaces

#### 2.2 Fix Implicit Any Types âœ…
- [x] Fixed implicit any in lab/[id]/page.tsx for component mapping
- [x] Added proper type guards for content access
- [x] Fixed type assertions for metadata properties

#### 2.3 Builder Component Types âœ…
- [x] Fixed Section type import in builder
- [x] Fixed ResizablePreview props alignment
- [x] Ensured proper type definitions for builder state

#### 2.4 Lab Editor Fixes âœ…
- [x] Fixed lab/[id]/page.tsx TypeScript errors
- [x] Fixed lab/[id]/preview/route.tsx type guards
- [x] Added TODOs for lab editor refactor (currently hardcoded for HeroTwoColumn)

#### 2.5 Remaining Type Errors (258 total)
- [x] Lab theme pages (~17 errors) - FIXED: Refactored ThemeVariables from nested to flat structure
- [ ] Test file mocks (~115 errors) - mock type definitions needed
- [x] API route types (~22 errors) - FIXED: async params and Supabase auth patterns
- [ ] Component props (~45 errors) - various component type mismatches  
- [ ] Service utilities (~65 errors) - database query and auth types
- [ ] Library page errors (~16 errors) - type assertions and content access

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Library Integration Fixes (PENDING)

#### 3.1 React Email Integration

## Error Categories & Fixes

### Category A: Missing Type Definitions
**Impact**: High (blocks build)  
**Effort**: Low (install packages)  
**Priority**: Phase 1

### Category B: Application Interface Mismatches
**Impact**: High (runtime errors)  
**Effort**: Medium (refactor types)  
**Priority**: Phase 2

### Category C: Library Integration Issues
**Impact**: Medium (feature-specific)  
**Effort**: Medium (configuration)  
**Priority**: Phase 3

### Category D: Build Tool Configuration
**Impact**: Low (developer experience)  
**Effort**: Low (config changes)  
**Priority**: Phase 4

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase has a git commit for safe rollback
- Stash changes before major modifications
- Test core functionality after each phase
- Maintain backup branch if needed

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors in build
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Core application functionality works
- [ ] Successful Vercel deployment
- [ ] No runtime type errors in production

## Notes & Lessons Learned
- Next.js 15 async params pattern was critical for build success
- ESLint pre-commit hooks caught type safety issues early
- Systematic approach prevents regression of fixed errors
- ThemeVariables flat structure simplifies color management
- Type guards are essential for union type property access
- Supabase server client requires await in Next.js 15

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2.5 - Fixing Remaining Type Errors  
**Next Action**: Fix test file mock type definitions

## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Lab Editor Architecture Issue**: The lab editor is currently hardcoded to only work with HeroTwoColumn sections. It needs to be refactored to dynamically handle different section types based on the draft.type and draft.component_name.

2. **Type Union Challenges**: Many errors stem from accessing properties on union types (SectionContent | PageContent | SiteContent | ThemeVariables). Proper type guards are needed throughout.

3. **Test Infrastructure**: A large portion of remaining errors (~41%) are in test files, indicating we need to update our test mocking strategy for the new type system.

4. **Progress Tracking**: We've successfully reduced errors by 43% (from 452 to 258) by systematically fixing type definitions and core application interfaces.

5. **ThemeVariables Structure Change**: Discovered that ThemeVariables changed from nested structure (e.g., `colors.primary`) to flat structure (e.g., `primary`). This affected multiple theme-related components.

6. **Next.js 15 Async Patterns**: All API routes now properly await `createSupabaseServerClient()` and handle async params correctly.
