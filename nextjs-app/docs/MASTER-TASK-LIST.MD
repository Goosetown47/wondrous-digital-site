### 2025-07-24

### 2025-07-26 (Later - Service Role Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Fixed "Projects not showing for admins" issue with comprehensive service role pattern:
  - **Root Cause**: Client-side RLS policies were checking auth context, but admins weren't members of accounts they needed to manage
  - **Solution**: Implemented service role pattern (like Stripe/Shopify) for admin operations
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created server-side admin client using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` that bypasses RLS
    - Built systematic pattern: Client ‚Üí API Route ‚Üí Service (with admin client) ‚Üí Database
    - Updated all management services to use this pattern:
      - User Management: `/api/users/*` endpoints with full auth.users access
      - Admin Management: `/api/admins/*` endpoints for promotion/demotion
      - Core Components: `/api/core-components/*` with individual endpoints
      - Themes: `/api/themes/*` endpoints for theme operations
      - Lab Drafts: `/api/lab/*` endpoints (partially completed)
    - Fixed date formatting consistency issues across all services
    - Added proper error handling and logging throughout
  - **Key Learning**: Platform management tools require service-level access, not user-level RLS

### 2025-07-26 (Even Later - Builder Authentication Fix)
- ‚úÖ Fixed builder authentication error and implemented industry-standard patterns:
  - **Issue 1**: Dynamic route parameter conflict between `[id]` and `[projectId]` in API routes
    - Fixed by consolidating to `[id]` and updating parameter usage
  - **Issue 2**: Builder redirect page was server component making unauthenticated fetch to API
    - Root cause: Server components can't forward cookies properly to API routes
    - Fixed by converting to client component using existing `useHomepage` hook
  - **Architecture Decision**: Following industry standards (Webflow, Figma, Shopify):
    - Admin/Management tools use service role pattern (server-side with elevated privileges)
    - User-facing tools (Builder, Preview) use client authentication with React Query
    - This maintains proper separation of concerns and security boundaries
  - **Updated Files**:
    - `/src/app/(app)/builder/[projectId]/page.tsx` - Now client component
    - `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/theme/route.ts` - Fixed parameter naming
