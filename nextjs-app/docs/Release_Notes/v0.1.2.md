# Release Notes - v0.1.2 "Critical Infrastructure"

**Release Date**: [In Development]
**Focus**: Infrastructure improvements and security enhancements

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.1.2 strengthens the platform's security foundation by implementing proper access controls across all administrative APIs and fixing critical infrastructure gaps.

## ✨ New Features

### API Security Enhancements
- **Admin/Staff Access Controls**: All administrative APIs now require proper authentication and role verification
  - Theme management APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - Core component APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - Library management APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - Lab APIs restricted to admin/staff only
- **403 Forbidden Response**: Regular users attempting to access admin APIs receive proper error responses

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Audit Logging**: New audit_logs table tracks all platform actions for compliance and debugging
- **Account-Aware Services**: Pages service now properly validates account access before operations
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive test suite ensures API access controls work correctly

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing audit_logs table that was causing silent failures in logging
- Pages service now properly checks account access instead of assuming isolation
- API endpoints now enforce the same access controls as the UI

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Database
- Created `audit_logs` table with proper RLS policies
- Added indexes for performant audit log queries
- Platform admins can view all logs, users see only their account's logs

### API Updates
- Added `isAdminServer` and `isStaffServer` permission checks to all admin routes
- Standardized 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access
- Maintained service role pattern for actual database queries (performance)

### Testing
- Added unit tests for all API security endpoints
- Verified authentication, authorization, and role-based access
- Confirmed no database queries occur when permissions are denied

## 🚀 Performance

No performance impact - permission checks happen before database queries, maintaining the same query performance as before.

## 📋 Migration Notes

1. Run the new database migration to create the audit_logs table:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --password 'aTR9dv8Q7J2emyMD'
   ```

2. No code changes required for existing functionality - all changes are backward compatible

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Regular users can no longer access admin APIs via direct API calls
- All admin actions are now logged for audit trails
- Account isolation is properly enforced at the service layer

## 📝 Developer Notes

- When creating new admin APIs, always add permission checks using `isAdminServer` or `isStaffServer`
- Use the `verifyProjectAccess` pattern from pages service for account-scoped resources
- All admin actions should log to audit_logs for compliance
