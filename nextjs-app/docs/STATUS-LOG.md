# STATUS LOG
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

**Production Version:** v0.1.4 
**Development Version:** v0.1.5

This is an ongoing log of everything we do across the application, from bug fixes to whatever. Every time we do a work segment this should be updated. When we’ve created a sprint, the contents of what’s in ACTIVE_SPRINT will be cataloged here as well. This should include any Claude notes to self, things we’ve learned, or done, it should be a comprehensive accounting.

# VERSION 0.1.4 "Final Account Managmenet Features"
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #


### Goal: Finalize all our missing account management and admin features (needed for MVP)

### Notes:
Our initial MVP status launch will be aimed at getting to 25 customers as quickly as we can. We need to ensure all the features in our TOOLS section is finalized and up to date. We also need to ensure that our basic features in Account Management for account_owners is set up properly.

### [PACKET] Final Account Fixes & Updates
*These are the final clean up tasks we need to complete before moving on to the next release*

**User Profiles**
- [x] 🪲 Create missing user_profiles entries for existing users
- [x] 🚀 Add profile creation trigger for new users
- [x] ⚗️ Verify profile form elements are accessible

**Settings**
- [x] ⚠ This section in Settings (this is the link in the dropdown connected to the account at the bottom of the sidebar) has nothing really in it. It's placeholder. We either need to comment it out until we do something, or add some functionality.
- [x] ⚠ Check the Security tab. We should remove the two factor auth and active sessions, but should fix the change password functionality.
- [x] ⚠ The items in profile should work - a way to change your email and display name.
- [x] ⚠ We should make the avatar photo work. We'll need to set up a bucket on supabase to hold the user images.

**Project Details**
- [x] 🪲 Fix "Created by" to use user_profiles/display_name (currently shows raw user ID)
  This is in the Tools/Projects/Settings view. The overview tab has "Created by" b9c3e24e-c5da-491d-90c5-f733d8bd7c77 which isn't helpful info.

**UI Cleanup**
- [ ] 🚀 Move "back" link above HEADER
- [x] 🪲 Remove/fix redundant edit button in settings view
- [x] 🪲 Temporarily comment out the Account Management / Account Settings item in sidebar nav as it is unfinished and doesn't have a page. Also it's redundant and in drop-up for the account selector at the bottom.

**Bug Fixes**
- [x] 🪲 Users table doesn't auto-refresh without a page reload when something changes
- [ ] 🪲 [Management/Tools/Users/Multiple Users Selected / Action box] The users select div with "change role" and "remove from account" and clear selection options needs to have consistent looking buttons instead of just text or buttons
- [x] 🪲 The users select div with "change role" and "remove from account" and clear selection stays active even when the selected item in the list is no longer there (e.g., I deleted it) (it works if I deselect it) -- It should actively check if something is selected or not, then respond accordingly
- [x] 🪲 Project Settings / General tab: The Preview Domain still has ".sites" in it and we don't use that sub sub domain anymore. The Domains tab is correct
- [x] 🪲 Toast notifications often double up (we get two at the same time, duplicates). This happens for many actions across the app.
- [x] 🪲 In library, the unpublished / all toggle looks janky. It's not a real toggle component and should be.
- [x] 🪲 In Lab, the pill boxes that contain the tag for what an item is (theme, section, etc.) has dark text on a relatively dark color bg. We should keep the color bg but make the text white or a light version of the color to create proper contrast.

**Staff Assignments** 
- [x] ✂️ Let's comment out Staff Assignments pages right now. There is "Staff/ My Assignments" and "Management / Tools / Staff Assignments" pages. We can keep them in the codebase but remove them from the navigation. We're going to address these way down the road when we hire employees. Could be a year potentially. Don't delete the functionality or the role, but let's just remove it from the UI or comment it out for later.


**Build Warnings (DISCUSS THIS)**
*Do we need to take care of these things? I want to have a discussion*
- [x] ⚠ Linting is disabled. (Should it be?)
      ⚠ Warning: Found multiple lockfiles. Selecting
- [x] /home/goosetown/package-lock.json. Consider removing the lockfiles at:
        * /home/goosetown/Claude/Projects/wondrous-digital-site/nextjs-app/package
     -lock.json
        * /home/goosetown/Claude/Projects/wondrous-digital-site/package-lock.json
      (Should we fix this?)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# VERSION 0.1.3 "Security Hardening"
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

### Goal: Complete the most important security updates we absolutely need before we launch in MVP 1.0 status.

### Notes:
Our initial MVP status launch will be aimed at getting to 25 customers as quickly as we can. We will not allow public sign ups until we're probably north of 50 customers on the platform and have time to polish the platform to a point the public may really want to sign up for it.



## PACKETS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##



### [PACKET] MVP Security Essentials
  **Goal:** Implement minimum viable security for manual user management
  **Deliverable:** Platform secure enough for 25 manually-managed customers

  ##### Critical XSS Prevention
  - [x] 🚀 Install and configure DOMPurify
  - [x] 🪲 Fix innerHTML usage in preview routes
  - [x] 🚀 Add basic input sanitization to all forms
  - [x] 🚀 Add length limits to prevent overflow attacks

  ##### Essential Security Headers
  - [x] 🚀 Implement basic security headers middleware
  - [x] 🚀 Configure secure cookies
  - [x] 🚀 Set up HSTS for production

  ##### RLS Verification
  - [x] ⚗️ Test cross-tenant data isolation (manually verified by user)
  - [x] ⚗️ Verify users can't access other accounts (manually verified by user)
  - [x] ⚗️ Test admin access patterns work correctly (manually verified by user)
  - [x] 🚀 Fix any RLS gaps found (no gaps found)

  ##### Authentication Basics
  - [x] 🚀 Implement password reset flow (using Resend with branded emails)
  - [x] 🚀 Add session timeout (basic - configured in security headers)
  - [x] 🚀 Remove public signup (as you mentioned)



## MANUAL TESTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##

### XSS Prevention Stories:
- [x] **As a platform admin**, I can trust that user-generated content (project names, descriptions) is sanitized so that XSS attacks cannot execute
- [x] **As a platform admin**, I can safely preview customer websites without risk of malicious scripts executing in my browser
- [x] **As any user**, I cannot inject scripts through form fields that would affect other users

### Security Headers Stories:
- [⚠️] **As a platform user**, my session cookies are protected with httpOnly and secure flags so they can't be stolen via JavaScript
  - *Note: Supabase auth cookies cannot be HttpOnly by design (client needs access for token refresh). SameSite=Lax is set for CSRF protection, and we have comprehensive XSS prevention.*
- [x] **As a platform user**, I am protected from clickjacking attacks when using the application
- [x] **As a platform admin**, the production site enforces HTTPS via HSTS headers

### RLS/Access Control Stories:
- [x] **As a regular user**, I cannot access data from accounts I don't belong to
- [x] **As a regular user**, I cannot see other users' projects or settings
- [x] **As a platform admin**, I can access all accounts and projects for support purposes
- [x] **As an account owner**, only I and platform admins can see my account's sensitive data

### Authentication Stories:
- [x] **As a user who forgot my password**, I can request a password reset link via email
- [x] **As a visitor**, I cannot sign up for a new account (signup is disabled for MVP)
- [x] **As a platform admin**, I can manually create accounts for our 25 initial customers

### Edge Cases:
- [x] **As a malicious user**, I cannot overflow form fields to cause database errors or crashes
- [x] **As a user**, I see appropriate error messages when security validations fail

### Day 2 - Completed a HARD reset of the DEV database and created a complete copy of the PROD database.
#### Notes:
Then replaced existing DEV database with the copy of PROD so they are now 100% in sync. I worked with Claude Opus 4.1 in the Desktop application to complete these tasks. Everything is verified and working properly.

### Day 3 - XSS Prevention Testing & Fixes
- ✅ Fixed XSS validation across all input fields:
  - Enhanced sanitization to detect encoded HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;script&gt;`)
  - Fixed client-side sanitization that was preventing proper validation messages
  - Added comprehensive server-side validation for all create/update operations
  - Implemented `wouldBeSanitized()` function to detect HTML without modifying input
- ✅ Completed manual testing of XSS prevention:
  - Project creation/update: PASSED (rejects scripts, shows field-specific errors)
  - User creation: PASSED (properly validates full name, display name)
  - Account creation/update: PASSED (validates name, slug, description)
  - Preview display: PASSED (safe rendering, no script execution)
- ✅ Fixed lab preview route (direct DB access instead of HTTP round-trip)
- ✅ Fixed user deletion to properly CASCADE delete from all related tables
- ✅ All XSS Prevention user stories verified and working
- ✅ Edge cases handled: overflow attacks prevented, clear error messages shown

### Day 3 (cont.) - Security Headers Verification

  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Content-Security-Policy configured
  - HSTS configured for production
  - All headers applied via middleware
- ⚠️ Important finding: Supabase auth cookies cannot be HttpOnly by design
  - This is intentional - client JavaScript needs access for token refresh
  - Mitigation: SameSite=Lax is set (CSRF protection)
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive XSS prevention already implemented
- ✅ All Security Headers stories verified (with noted limitation)

Here are the notes from Claude Opus 4.1 Desktop:
# Database Synchronization Report
**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Project**: wondrous-digital-site (Next.js on Vercel with Supabase)

## Executive Summary
Successfully synchronized DEV database with PROD database. Both environments now have identical schemas, data, and configurations. DEV database was having issues and has been completely replaced with a copy of the working PROD database.

## Environment Details

### PROD Database
- **Project ID**: `bpdhbxvsguklkbusqtke`
- **Region**: us-east-2
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Direct Connection**: `postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.bpdhbxvsguklkbusqtke.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
- **Session Pooler**: `postgresql://postgres.bpdhbxvsguklkbusqtke:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`

### DEV Database
- **Project ID**: `hlpvvwlxjzexpgitsjlw`
- **Region**: us-east-2
- **Status**: ✅ Now working (exact copy of PROD)
- **Direct Connection**: `postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.hlpvvwlxjzexpgitsjlw.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
- **Session Pooler**: `postgresql://postgres.hlpvvwlxjzexpgitsjlw:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`

## Problem Solved
1. DEV database was out of sync and problematic
2. Migrations were inconsistent between environments
3. Local migration files didn't match database state
4. Authentication users and account_users tables were mismatched

## Actions Performed

### 1. Database Backup
Created complete backup of PROD database:
```bash
pg_dump "postgresql://postgres.bpdhbxvsguklkbusqtke:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" > prod-complete.sql
```
- **Location**: `~/prod-backup/prod-complete.sql`
- **Note**: Used Session Pooler URL to avoid IPv6 connectivity issues

### 2. DEV Database Reset
Completely cleared DEV database:
```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; 
CREATE SCHEMA public;
```
This removed 34 objects including tables, functions, and policies.

### 3. Database Restoration
Restored PROD backup to DEV:
```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres.hlpvvwlxjzexpgitsjlw:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" < prod-complete.sql
```

### 4. Authentication Data Sync
- Cleared DEV auth.users table (CASCADE deleted related tables)
- Restored auth.users from PROD
- Separately restored account_users table data

### 5. File Organization
- Created backup directory: `~/database-backups/`
- Backed up entire supabase folder: `~/database-backups/supabase-backup-20250813/`
- Cleaned up redundant migration folders (migrations-backup, migrations-clean)
- Restored original migration files

## Current State

### Database Synchronization
✅ DEV and PROD databases are identical:
- Same table structures
- Same data
- Same RLS policies  
- Same functions and triggers
- Same auth users
- Same account_users relationships

## Important Notes

### Connection Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: IPv6 connectivity issues with direct database URLs
- **Solution**: Use Session Pooler URLs (aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com)
- **Why**: Session Pooler endpoints resolve to IPv4 addresses

### Docker Limitations
- Supabase CLI commands requiring Docker (`supabase db pull`, `supabase db diff`) won't work
- Workaround: Use direct PostgreSQL commands with pooler URLs

### What Was NOT Copied
- Storage files (actual uploaded images/documents)
- Edge Functions  
- Environment variables/secrets
- SMTP configuration

## Recommended Workflow Going Forward

### For Database Changes
1. **Make changes in DEV first** via Supabase Dashboard
2. **Document changes** in a new migration file:
   ```bash
   echo "-- Description: [change description]
   -- Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   
   [SQL STATEMENTS];" > supabase/migrations/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)_change_name.sql
   ```
3. **Test thoroughly** in DEV
4. **Apply to PROD** via SQL Editor in PROD Dashboard
5. **Commit migration file** to version control

### For Claude Code
- All database structure is documented in `/supabase/migrations/` files
- DEV and PROD are currently identical
- Use DEV for all development and testing
- Session Pooler URLs work better than direct connections

### Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Connect to DEV
psql "postgresql://postgres.hlpvvwlxjzexpgitsjlw:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Connect to PROD  
psql "postgresql://postgres.bpdhbxvsguklkbusqtke:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Backup database
pg_dump "[POOLER_URL]" > backup.sql

# Restore database
psql "[POOLER_URL]" < backup.sql
```

## Security Recommendations
1. ✅ Change both database passwords (visible in terminal history)
2. ✅ Use environment variables for connection strings
3. ✅ Never commit passwords to version control
4. ✅ Clear terminal history: `history -c && history -w`

## Verification Steps
To verify everything is working:
1. Check DEV Dashboard - all tables should have data
2. Check Authentication > Users - should match PROD
3. Check account_users table - should have proper user-account relationships
4. Test your application against DEV - should work identically to PROD

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Both databases are synchronized and ready for development.

## PACKETS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##


#### [Packet] Service Layer & API Updates
**Goal:** Complete account-aware implementation gaps and fix critical infrastructure  
**Deliverable:** Fully account-aware service layer with proper audit logging
**Note:** Much of the foundation is already built - we're filling in gaps and completing partial implementations

##### Critical Infrastructure Fix

Created the Missing Audit Logs Table 📊
- [x] 🪲 Create audit_logs table migration (currently missing but referenced in code!)
  - [x] 🪲 Design table schema based on existing audit service usage
  - [x] 🪲 Create migration file with proper indexes
  - [x] 🪲 Test audit logging works after table creation

  The Problem: Your code was trying to write to an audit_logs table that didn't
  exist! Every time someone created a project, updated a page, or changed
  settings, the code tried to log it but silently failed.

  What I Did:
  - Created a proper audit_logs table in your database
  - Added security policies so users can only see logs for their own accounts
  - Platform admins can see everything (for support/debugging)

  Why It's Better:
  - You now have a complete history of who did what and when
  - Great for security compliance (some customers require this)
  - Helps with debugging ("Why did this project disappear?")
  - Enables features like "Activity Feed" for users


##### Service Layer Account Context Gaps
**Update Pages service with full account context**
The Problem: The Pages service was partially trusting that pages wouldn't be
accessed across accounts, but it wasn't actively checking. It's like having
apartment doors that usually stay locked but don't actually verify your key.

The Key Addition - verifyProjectAccess():
  This function checks:
  1. Is the user a platform admin? (They can see everything)
  2. Is the user a member of the account that owns this project?
  3. If neither, throw "Access Denied"

- [x] 🚀 Update Pages service with full account context
  - [x] 🚀 Add account_id filtering to all page queries
  - [x] 🚀 Ensure pages can't be accessed cross-account
  - [x] 🚀 Update page creation to use account context
  - [x] 🚀 Added verifyProjectAccess() function for all operations
  - [x] 🚀 Added missing functions (duplicatePage, publishPageDraft, etc.)
  - [x] 🚀 Fixed all TypeScript errors and build passes



- [x] 🚀 Add admin/staff access controls to platform APIs
  - [x] 🚀 Theme APIs now require admin/staff role (403 for regular users)
  - [x] 🚀 Core Components APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - [x] 🚀 Library APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - [x] 🚀 Lab APIs restricted to admin/staff only
  - [x] 🚀 All APIs return consistent 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
  - [x] 🚀 Permission checks happen before database queries (performance)
  - [x] 🚀 Service role pattern maintained for actual queries

##### Standardize Error Handling
- [x] 🚀 Create consistent permission denied errors
  - [x] 🚀 All admin APIs return 403 with "Access denied. Admin or staff role required."
  - [x] 🚀 Consistent error format across all protected endpoints
- [x] 🚀 Security-focused error messages
  - [x] 🚀 Don't reveal why access was denied (security best practice)
  - [x] 🚀 Log access attempts to audit_logs for monitoring

##### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] 🚀 Created comprehensive API security test suite
  - [x] 🚀 Tests for unauthenticated access (401 responses)
  - [x] 🚀 Tests for regular user access (403 responses)
  - [x] 🚀 Tests for staff access (200 responses)
  - [x] 🚀 Tests for admin access (200 responses)
  - [x] 🚀 Verified permission checks happen before DB queries
  - [x] 🚀 All 20 security tests passing

##### Already Completed (Found During Scan)
- ✅ useAccount(), useAccountProjects(), useAccountUsers() hooks exist
- ✅ Permission system with hasPermission() and requirePermission()
- ✅ Account switching functionality
- ✅ Projects service has account filtering
- ✅ Basic audit logging implementation (just needs table)

##### Service Layer Summary
**What We Accomplished:**
1. **Fixed Critical Infrastructure** - Created missing audit_logs table that was causing silent failures
2. **Secured Admin APIs** - All Lab/Library/Core/Theme APIs now properly restricted to admin/staff only
3. **Maintained Performance** - Permission checks happen before DB queries, no performance impact
4. **Added Comprehensive Tests** - 20+ security tests ensure APIs can't be accessed by regular users
5. **Consistent Security Model** - Backend now enforces same restrictions as UI (no bypassing via API)

**Key Architecture Decision:**
Instead of making themes/library account-specific, we properly restricted them to admin/staff only.
This aligns with the platform design where regular users work through the Builder, not direct API access.



---

#### [Packet] User Creation Features
**Goal:** Create the ability for admins to create users for accounts manually in the admin tools area.

##### User Stories
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can create new users directly so that I can quickly set up test accounts and onboard users without email verification delays
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can specify all user details (email, password, name, role) so that users are ready to use immediately  
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can assign users to specific accounts during creation so that they have immediate access to the right resources
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can choose whether to auto-confirm email so that test users can log in immediately
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I see validation errors if I enter invalid data so that I create users correctly
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I see an error if I try to create a user with an existing email (edge case)
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can generate a secure random password if needed (edge case)
- [x] 🚀 As a platform admin, I can delete any user.

##### Implementation Tasks
- [x] 🚀 Pre-flight checks: Verify environment is clean (0 TypeScript/ESLint errors)
- [x] 🚀 Create `/app/api/users/create/route.ts` - Admin-only POST endpoint

**Database Migration Workflow Notes:**
1. **Development Process**: Claude creates migration files in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. **Testing**: Claude applies to DEV using: `npx supabase db push --password "MsDH6QjUsf6vXD3nCeYkBNiF"`
3. **Production**: User manually applies migrations to PROD via Supabase Dashboard for safety
4. **Key Passwords**: 
   - DEV: MsDH6QjUsf6vXD3nCeYkBNiF
   - PROD: User controls via Dashboard
5. **Migration Naming**: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql` or sequential numbers for related changes









# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# VERSION 0.1.1
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

### Goal: Solidify our platform architecture and most recent major release.

### Notes:
This sprint takes all our critical items from fixing database security issues, to segmenting out our databases for production and development, to testing and completing domain management, and verifying our last deployment works properly. This is considered a proper "follow up" to our major release in v0.1.0.


## PACKETS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##


#### [Packet] Reserved Subdomain Protection System
**Goal:** Prevent unauthorized use of reserved subdomains and protect critical platform infrastructure endpoints
**Note:** This is a critical security feature to prevent phishing, confusion, and unauthorized access to system subdomains. Refer to /docs/Security/RESERVED-SUBDOMAINS.md for the complete list.
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive validation system that prevents regular users from using reserved slugs/subdomains while allowing admin override

##### Current State (What Exists)
- ✅ Basic RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS array in `/src/middleware.ts` (8 items: app, www, sites, api, admin, docs, blog, support)
- ✅ Limited domain validation in `/src/lib/services/domains.ts` (3 items: localhost, example.com, test.com)
- ✅ Hardcoded checks for wondrousdigital.com domains in `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/domains/route.ts`
- ✅ Admin permission system with `is_system_admin()` function
- ❌ No centralized slug validation service
- ❌ No integration with project creation/update flows
- ❌ No comprehensive pattern matching (single letters, numbers, variations)

##### Core Implementation

  - Show category-specific error messages
  - Handle admin override with audit logging
- [x] 🚀 Update project settings slug change (`/src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`)
  - Validate new slug on PATCH requests
  - Prevent changes to reserved slugs
  - Log attempts to use reserved slugs
- [x] 🚀 Enhance domain validation (`/src/app/api/projects/[id]/domains/route.ts`)
  - Expand from 2 hardcoded domains to full reserved list
  - Check subdomains against all reserved patterns
  - Maintain existing admin override logic
- [x] 🚀 Integrate admin override mechanism
  - Use existing `is_system_admin()` function
  - Add audit logging for overrides
  - Show warning UI when admin uses reserved name

##### Validation Coverage
- [x] ⚗️ Test all 12 categories from RESERVED-SUBDOMAINS.md
  - Core Infrastructure (10 patterns)
  - Authentication & Security (20 patterns)
  - Development & Operations (20 patterns)
  - Infrastructure Services (25 patterns)
  - Communication & Support (20 patterns)
  - Monitoring & Analytics (15 patterns)
  - Business & Legal (15 patterns)
  - User Management (15 patterns)
  - Marketing & Sales (15 patterns)
  - Internal & System (10 patterns)
  - Special Patterns (single letters, numbers, variations)
  - Phishing & Abuse Prevention (15 patterns)
- [x] ⚗️ Verify case-insensitive matching works correctly
- [x] ⚗️ Test single-letter (a-z) and numeric pattern blocking
- [x] ⚗️ Verify admin users can override restrictions
- [x] ⚗️ Test API-level validation cannot be bypassed

##### User Experience
- [ ] 🚀 Add helpful suggestions when slug is reserved
- [x] 🚀 Create UI indicators for admin override usage
- [x] 🚀 Add slug availability check before form submission

##### Progress Log @ 8/10/2025
**Phase 1 Implementation Complete - Slug Validation**

###### Created Centralized Slug Validation Service
- New file: `/src/lib/services/slug-validation.ts` with 300+ reserved patterns
- Implements 12 categories of reserved slugs from RESERVED-SUBDOMAINS.md
- Special handling for single letters, numbers, HTTP codes, emergency numbers  
- Admin override capability with appropriate logging
- Security-focused error messages that don't reveal why names are reserved

###### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Created `/src/lib/services/__tests__/slug-validation.test.ts`
- Tests all categories, edge cases, and admin overrides
- Validates case-insensitive matching and special patterns
- Ensures generic error messages for security

###### Updated Project Creation Flows
- `/src/lib/services/projects.ts` - Added validation to createProject and updateProject
- `/src/app/(app)/tools/projects/new/page.tsx` - Real-time validation UI
- `/src/components/projects/CreateProjectDialog.tsx` - Same validation in dialog
- Visual feedback: red alerts for users, yellow warnings for admins

###### Updated Project Settings
- `/src/app/(app)/project/[projectId]/settings/page.tsx` - Slug change validation
- Real-time validation as user types
- Prevents saving invalid slugs (unless admin override)
- Clear visual feedback with appropriate error/warning messages

###### Security Enhancement
- User feedback: "We shouldn't be specific about why something is reserved"
- Changed all error messages to generic: "This name is reserved, please choose a different name. Reach out to support at hello@wondrousdigital.com if you need help."
- Prevents revealing system architecture through error messages

###### Key Implementation Details
- Used readonly arrays with TypeScript type assertions for includes()
- Fixed empty string validation order issues
- Switched from usePermissions to useHasPermission hook
- All slug validation is case-insensitive
- Admin users see warnings but can proceed

###### Next Tasks
- ~~Enhance domain validation with reserved patterns~~ ✅
- ~~Add integration tests for subdomain protection~~ ✅
- Consider middleware integration for runtime protection

##### Progress Log @ 8/10/2025 (Continued)
**Phase 2 Implementation Complete - Domain Validation**

###### Enhanced Domain Validation
- Updated `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/domains/route.ts` to use slug validation service
- Added `extractSubdomain()` helper to parse subdomains from full domains
- Validates all subdomains against 300+ reserved patterns
- Maintains special handling for wondrousdigital.com apex domain
- Platform admins can override all restrictions

###### Comprehensive Testing
- Created `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/domains/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- Tests reserved subdomain rejection (app, auth, single letters, numbers)
- Tests admin override capability
- Tests companion domain validation (apex <-> www)
- Ensures generic error messages for security

###### Key Implementation Details
- Subdomain extraction handles multi-level domains correctly
- Companion domains (www) are also validated
- Admin overrides are logged with warning messages
- All validation uses the same generic error message

##### Progress Log @ 8/10/2025
**Database Security Hardening Implementation**

###### SQL Injection Prevention
- Created migration `20250810200000_fix_function_search_paths_security.sql`
- Fixed all 20 SECURITY DEFINER functions by adding `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- This prevents search_path manipulation attacks that could lead to privilege escalation
- Functions fixed include: has_role, is_system_admin, check_user_access, and all trigger functions

###### Extension Security
- Created migration `20250810201000_move_pg_net_extension.sql`
- Moves pg_net extension from public schema to dedicated 'extensions' schema
- Improves security isolation for PostgreSQL extensions
- No code changes needed as pg_net is not directly referenced in application code

###### Auth Security Configuration
- Created migration `20250810202000_auth_security_settings.sql`
- Documents required manual configuration in Supabase Dashboard:
  - OTP expiry must be reduced to 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
  - Leaked password protection must be enabled
- Added security_configuration_checks table to track compliance
- Provides function to mark configurations as compliant after dashboard updates

###### Additional Security Fixes Applied
- Created migration `20250810203000_fix_rls_security_checks.sql`
  - Enabled RLS on security_configuration_checks table
  - Added policies: anyone can read, only system admins can update
  - Prevents insertions/deletions to maintain data integrity
- Created migration `20250810204000_force_fix_function_search_paths.sql`
  - Used ALTER FUNCTION to force set search_path on all functions
  - More aggressive approach that ensures all SECURITY DEFINER functions are fixed
  - Successfully applied to all 20+ functions

###### Migration Results
- ✅ All 5 migrations successfully applied to database
- ✅ All functions tested and working correctly with new search_path
- ✅ RLS enabled on security_configuration_checks table
- ✅ pg_net extension moved to extensions schema
- ⚠️  Auth settings still require manual dashboard configuration

###### Final Resolution - Orphaned Functions Removed
- Created migration `20250810210000_clean_sweep_orphaned_functions.sql`
  - Identified that the 8 problematic functions were from old migrations (now in temp_remove/)
  - These functions were NOT in the current baseline and NOT used in the application
  - Successfully dropped all orphaned functions using CASCADE
  - This resolved all function_search_path_mutable warnings

###### Key Findings
- The functions were remnants from the pre-migration-reset era
- Migration reset cleaned files but left database objects behind
- Functions like is_system_admin() and generate_project_slug were being used by old triggers/policies
- Clean removal via CASCADE handled all dependencies safely
- Initial drops failed due to incorrect function signatures
- Final fix: Created migration with exact signatures from diagnostic query:
  - `get_deployment_url(varchar, varchar, text)`
  - `transition_project_status(uuid, project_status_type, uuid, text)`
- All function_search_path_mutable warnings are now resolved

###### Remaining Manual Steps
1. Update Supabase Dashboard auth settings:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers > Email
   - Set OTP Expiry to 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
2. After updating, mark as compliant in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT mark_security_check_compliant('auth_otp_expiry');
   SELECT mark_security_check_compliant('auth_leaked_password_protection');
   ```

### Log Entry (Date: 8/7/2025)

Fixed critical issue where domains remained orphaned in Vercel account after deletion, causing "already in use" errors when users try to re-add them. Updated domain removal to delete from both project AND account for clean domain management.

#### Log Items

- **Migration History Reset**:
  - Backed up database before making changes
  - Archived all existing migrations to `/migrations_archive_20250809/`
  - Cleared remote migration history in Supabase
  - Created new baseline migration from production schema export
  - Successfully applied baseline migration (20250809230000)

- **Schema Corrections**:
  - Fixed user_profiles table - uses `user_id` as PK, not `id`
  - Baseline now matches exact production schema
  - Includes all tables: accounts, projects, pages, user_profiles, etc.

- **www.wondrousdigital.com Fix**:
  - Added www.wondrousdigital.com to reserved_domain_permissions
  - Discovered middleware requires both permission AND project_domains entry
  - Updated middleware to simplify routing for marketing domains
  - Fix requires deployment to Vercel to take effect

- **Key Learnings**:
  - Migration file names must match exactly between local and remote
  - Always use production schema exports for baselines
  - Middleware runs on Vercel edge, not local dev server
  - Reserved domains need special handling in middleware

- **Next Steps**:
  - Deploy middleware changes to fix www subdomain
  - Monitor for any migration sync issues
  - Consider documenting migration best practices

- **Issue**: Custom domains (lahaie-private-server.com) showing 404 despite being configured in Vercel
- **Root Cause**: Database `verified = false` because we checked Vercel's "domain exists" status instead of "DNS configured" status
- **Fix**: Updated domain-verification.ts to set `verified = status.configured` (DNS ready) instead of `status.verified` (domain exists)
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `/src/lib/services/domain-verification.ts` - Lines 93, 114
  - `/src/app/api/domains/[id]/verify/route.ts` - Line 72
- **Next Steps**: User needs to click "Verify Domain" button to update database with correct verification status

- **Domain Orphan Issue Identified**
  - User reported "Failed to add domain: already in use" error when re-adding deleted domains
  - Found that domains remained in Vercel account after deletion from project
  - Discovered `removeDomainFromVercel` only removes from project, not account
  - Realized our single-project architecture doesn't need account-level domain persistence

- **Fast Track Fix Implementation**
  - Updated `removeDomainFromVercel` to remove domains from both project AND account
  - Added v9 API endpoint call: `DELETE /v9/domains/{domain}` after project removal
  - Added comprehensive logging for both removal operations
  - Handles 404 errors gracefully if domain already removed from account

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Tested domain deletion and re-addition flow successfully
  - Verified domains are completely removed from Vercel account
  - No TypeScript or ESLint errors
  - Preview deployment tested with lahaie-private-server.com domain

- **Architecture Decision**
  - Confirmed complete removal is correct for our platform architecture
  - We have ONE Vercel project for all customer websites
  - No need for domain portability between projects
  - Aligns with website builder standards (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow)

##### Account & Project Dropdowns
- ✅ 🪲 As admin, When I change the account from one to another, my current view changes to that account. (currently nothing happens. E.g., If I am on one accounts project, then switch to another account, I should only that accounts projects. Right now I am set to Test 2 account and their Test Project 1, but on Wondrous Digital's Veterinary Template 1. The side nav changes properly, but the project and canvas pages don't reset properly until I CLICK into the new page within their project. If I switch accounts from the drop down, all pages should reset to that context automatically.)
- ✅ 🪲 When I change the project drop down from one to another, the application refreshes and shows that project's content automatically.


##### Domain System Testing
**Notes:** This is mission critical. We need to ensure that domains work across the board. If we can't deploy to sub domains and domains, a website builder is no use. 
- ✅ ⚗️ Test preview domains load correctly (project-slug.sites.wondrousdigital.com)
  - Fixed: Changed to use admin client to bypass RLS for public site viewing
- ✅ ⚗️ Test custom domain addition flow
  - Verified: Domain verification works with Vercel API

### 2025-07-24
- 🟦 Started Phase 2: Multi-Tenant Foundation
  - **Discovered Critical Issues:**
    - Projects page showing hardcoded demo data instead of real projects
    - useCreateProject not setting customer_id (has TODO comment)
    - Authentication working but users can't create/access their projects
    - 500 errors due to RLS policies expecting proper user context
  - **Root Cause Analysis:**
    - Current architecture assumes 1 user = 1 customer (too simplistic)
    - No concept of accounts/organizations for multi-tenancy

### 2025-07-26 (Later - Service Role Implementation)
- ✅ Fixed "Projects not showing for admins" issue with comprehensive service role pattern:
  - **Root Cause**: Client-side RLS policies were checking auth context, but admins weren't members of accounts they needed to manage
  - **Solution**: Implemented service role pattern (like Stripe/Shopify) for admin operations
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created server-side admin client using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` that bypasses RLS
    - Built systematic pattern: Client → API Route → Service (with admin client) → Database
    - Updated all management services to use this pattern:
      - User Management: `/api/users/*` endpoints with full auth.users access
      - Admin Management: `/api/admins/*` endpoints for promotion/demotion
      - Core Components: `/api/core-components/*` with individual endpoints
      - Themes: `/api/themes/*` endpoints for theme operations
      - Lab Drafts: `/api/lab/*` endpoints (partially completed)
    - Fixed date formatting consistency issues across all services
    - Added proper error handling and logging throughout
  - **Key Learning**: Platform management tools require service-level access, not user-level RLS

### 2025-07-26 (Even Later - Builder Authentication Fix)
- ✅ Fixed builder authentication error and implemented industry-standard patterns:
  - **Issue 1**: Dynamic route parameter conflict between `[id]` and `[projectId]` in API routes
    - Fixed by consolidating to `[id]` and updating parameter usage
  - **Issue 2**: Builder redirect page was server component making unauthenticated fetch to API
    - Root cause: Server components can't forward cookies properly to API routes
    - Fixed by converting to client component using existing `useHomepage` hook
  - **Architecture Decision**: Following industry standards (Webflow, Figma, Shopify):
    - Admin/Management tools use service role pattern (server-side with elevated privileges)
    - User-facing tools (Builder, Preview) use client authentication with React Query
    - This maintains proper separation of concerns and security boundaries
  - **Updated Files**:
    - `/src/app/(app)/builder/[projectId]/page.tsx` - Now client component
    - `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/theme/route.ts` - Fixed parameter naming

# Sprint Process Guide (for reference)

## Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)

  1. [User will] Review BACKLOG.md → Pull priority items into ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  2. [User will] Set version number → Decide scope (major.minor.patch)
  3. [User will] Move packets → Cut H4 sections from BACKLOG to ACTIVE-SPRINT
  4. [User will] Order packets → Arrange by priority/dependency


## During Sprint Execution

### Per Packet Workflow:

  1. Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE.md → Full/Fast Track/Emergency mode per packet
  2. As you discover issues → Add to "Found Work" section:
    - Critical → Must fix in current version
    - Non-Critical → Defer to next version
    - Tech Debt → Document for future
  3. Update ACTIVE-STATUS.md → Log progress after each packet
  4. Check off tasks → Mark complete in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  5. [User will] Move to Sprint Backlog → When packet done, grab next

### Daily Flow:

  - Start: Check Current Focus in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  - Work: Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE for that packet
  - Discover: Add found issues to appropriate section
  - End: Update ACTIVE-SPRINT with progress

### Sprint Completion

  1. All packets done → Verify all tasks checked
  2. Create Release Notes → /docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.1.md
  3. [User will] Archive sprint content → Copy ACTIVE-SPRINT to STATUS-LOG
  4. [User will] Clear ACTIVE-SPRINT.md → Reset for next sprint
  5. [User will] Update version numbers → Production/Development in all docs


## Key Rules

  - COMPLETE DEV-LIFECYCLE per packet before moving on
  - DOCUMENT found work immediately
  - NEVER skip DEV-LIFECYCLE steps
  - Always use CODE-CHECKLIST
