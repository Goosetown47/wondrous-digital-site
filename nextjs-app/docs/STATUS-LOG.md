### LOG (Date: 8/9/2025 @ 4:45pm)
#### Version: v0.1.1 (Development - Migration Reset & www Fix)
#### Overview Summary

Reset Supabase migration history to resolve persistent sync issues and fixed www.wondrousdigital.com routing. Complete migration system overhaul with production schema baseline.

#### Log Items

- **Migration History Reset**:
  - Backed up database before making changes
  - Archived all existing migrations to `/migrations_archive_20250809/`
  - Cleared remote migration history in Supabase
  - Created new baseline migration from production schema export
  - Successfully applied baseline migration (20250809230000)

- **Schema Corrections**:
  - Fixed user_profiles table - uses `user_id` as PK, not `id`
  - Baseline now matches exact production schema
  - Includes all tables: accounts, projects, pages, user_profiles, etc.

- **www.wondrousdigital.com Fix**:
  - Added www.wondrousdigital.com to reserved_domain_permissions
  - Discovered middleware requires both permission AND project_domains entry
  - Updated middleware to simplify routing for marketing domains
  - Fix requires deployment to Vercel to take effect

- **Key Learnings**:
  - Migration file names must match exactly between local and remote
  - Always use production schema exports for baselines
  - Middleware runs on Vercel edge, not local dev server
  - Reserved domains need special handling in middleware

- **Next Steps**:
  - Deploy middleware changes to fix www subdomain
  - Monitor for any migration sync issues
  - Consider documenting migration best practices

- **Issue**: Custom domains (lahaie-private-server.com) showing 404 despite being configured in Vercel
- **Root Cause**: Database `verified = false` because we checked Vercel's "domain exists" status instead of "DNS configured" status
- **Fix**: Updated domain-verification.ts to set `verified = status.configured` (DNS ready) instead of `status.verified` (domain exists)
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `/src/lib/services/domain-verification.ts` - Lines 93, 114
  - `/src/app/api/domains/[id]/verify/route.ts` - Line 72
- **Next Steps**: User needs to click "Verify Domain" button to update database with correct verification status

### LOG (Date: 8/7/2025 @ 4:30pm)
#### Version: v0.1.1 (Development - Domain Removal Fix)
#### Overview Summary

Fixed critical issue where domains remained orphaned in Vercel account after deletion, causing "already in use" errors when users try to re-add them. Updated domain removal to delete from both project AND account for clean domain management.

#### Log Items

- **Domain Orphan Issue Identified**
  - User reported "Failed to add domain: already in use" error when re-adding deleted domains
  - Found that domains remained in Vercel account after deletion from project
  - Discovered `removeDomainFromVercel` only removes from project, not account
  - Realized our single-project architecture doesn't need account-level domain persistence

- **Fast Track Fix Implementation**
  - Updated `removeDomainFromVercel` to remove domains from both project AND account
  - Added v9 API endpoint call: `DELETE /v9/domains/{domain}` after project removal
  - Added comprehensive logging for both removal operations
  - Handles 404 errors gracefully if domain already removed from account

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Tested domain deletion and re-addition flow successfully
  - Verified domains are completely removed from Vercel account
  - No TypeScript or ESLint errors
  - Preview deployment tested with lahaie-private-server.com domain

- **Architecture Decision**
  - Confirmed complete removal is correct for our platform architecture
  - We have ONE Vercel project for all customer websites
  - No need for domain portability between projects
  - Aligns with website builder standards (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow)

### LOG (Date: 8/7/2025 @ 2:45am)
#### Version: v0.1.1 (Development - Domain Debug Enhancement)

Right now I am set to Test 2 account and their Test Project 1, but on Wondrous Digital's Veterinary Template 1. The side nav changes properly, but the project and canvas pages don't reset properly until I CLICK into the new page within their project. If I switch accounts from the drop down, all pages should reset to that context automatically.)
- ✅ 🪲 When I change the project drop down from one to another, the application refreshes and shows that project's content automatically.

### 2025-07-26 (Later - Service Role Implementation)
- ✅ Fixed "Projects not showing for admins" issue with comprehensive service role pattern:
  - **Root Cause**: Client-side RLS policies were checking auth context, but admins weren't members of accounts they needed to manage
  - **Solution**: Implemented service role pattern (like Stripe/Shopify) for admin operations
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created server-side admin client using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` that bypasses RLS
    - Built systematic pattern: Client → API Route → Service (with admin client) → Database
    - Updated all management services to use this pattern:
      - User Management: `/api/users/*` endpoints with full auth.users access
      - Admin Management: `/api/admins/*` endpoints for promotion/demotion
      - Core Components: `/api/core-components/*` with individual endpoints

  - **Issue 1**: Dynamic route parameter conflict between `[id]` and `[projectId]` in API routes
    - Fixed by consolidating to `[id]` and updating parameter usage
  - **Issue 2**: Builder redirect page was server component making unauthenticated fetch to API
    - Root cause: Server components can't forward cookies properly to API routes
    - Fixed by converting to client component using existing `useHomepage` hook
  - **Architecture Decision**: Following industry standards (Webflow, Figma, Shopify):
    - Admin/Management tools use service role pattern (server-side with elevated privileges)
    - User-facing tools (Builder, Preview) use client authentication with React Query
    - This maintains proper separation of concerns and security boundaries
  - **Updated Files**:
    - `/src/app/(app)/builder/[projectId]/page.tsx` - Now client component
    - `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/theme/route.ts` - Fixed parameter naming

# Sprint Process Guide

## Sprint Planning (Start of Sprint)

  1. Review BACKLOG.md → Pull priority items into ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  2. Set version number → Decide scope (major.minor.patch)
  3. Move packets → Cut H4 sections from BACKLOG to ACTIVE-SPRINT
  4. Order packets → Arrange by priority/dependency


## During Sprint Execution

### Per Packet Workflow:

  1. Move packet to Current Focus → Work on one packet at a time
  2. Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE.md → Full/Fast Track/Emergency mode per packet
  3. As you discover issues → Add to "Found Work" section:
    - Critical → Must fix in current version
    - Non-Critical → Defer to next version
    - Tech Debt → Document for future
  4. Update STATUS-LOG.md → Log progress after each packet
  5. Check off tasks → Mark complete in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  6. Move to Sprint Backlog → When packet done, grab next

### Daily Flow:

  - Start: Check Current Focus in ACTIVE-SPRINT.md
  - Work: Follow DEV-LIFECYCLE for that packet
  - Discover: Add found issues to appropriate section
  - End: Update STATUS-LOG with progress

### Sprint Completion

  1. All packets done → Verify all tasks checked
  2. Create Release Notes → /docs/Release_Notes/v0.1.1.md
  3. Archive sprint content → Copy ACTIVE-SPRINT to STATUS-LOG
  4. Clear ACTIVE-SPRINT.md → Reset for next sprint
  5. Update version numbers → Production/Development in all docs


## Key Rules

  - ONE packet in Current Focus at a time
  - COMPLETE DEV-LIFECYCLE per packet before moving on
  - DOCUMENT found work immediately
  - UPDATE STATUS-LOG per packet completion
  - NEVER skip DEV-LIFECYCLE steps
