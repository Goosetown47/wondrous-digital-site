# Project Status Update Fix

## Issue
The project status dropdown was not updating the status in Supabase when clicking the "Update" button.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used an RPC function `transition_project_status` that had strict validation rules for status transitions. This was preventing flexible status changes that admins should be able to make.

## Solution
1. **Updated the RPC function** to be more flexible for admin users (removed strict transition rules)

2. **Modified the handleStatusChange function** to:
   - Directly update the project status in the `projects` table
   - Fetch the current status before updating for audit purposes
   - Log the status change in the `project_status_history` table
   - Show better error messages and success notifications

3. **Added Toast notifications** instead of browser alerts:
   - Created a reusable Toast component
   - Shows success message with the new status label
   - Shows error messages if the update fails
   - Automatically dismisses after 3 seconds

## Features Added
- Console logging for debugging status changes
- Success toast notification showing the new status
- Error toast notification if update fails
- Proper status history logging
- Automatic refresh of project list and tab counts after status change

## How It Works Now
1. User selects a new status from the dropdown
2. User clicks "Update Status" button
3. The system:
   - Fetches current project status
   - Updates the project with new status
   - Logs the change in status history
   - Shows success toast notification
   - Refreshes the project list (moving item to appropriate tab)
   - Updates tab counts

The status update is now working correctly and provides good user feedback.
