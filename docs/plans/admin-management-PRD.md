# Overview of business process:

- We aim to have 100+ customers eventually with our business, which means potentially 100-200 websites and landing pages.
- We will be creating 4-5 templates that are niche specific that we want to stage on a [wondrousdigital.com](http://wondrousdigital.com/) subdomain so people can check them out. So the formula would be something like "nichetype-#.wondrousdigital.com" where nichetype and # represent the type of niche like "Veterinarian" and the template #.
- We will be cloning the templates to fill in with some customization and prospect data, then re-staging that cloned prospect site on another subdomain, using the customer business name as the subdomain name. E.g., "[raleighveterinarian.wondrousdigita.com](http://raleighveterinarian.wondrousdigita.com/)"
- We will reach out to the business and show them the website we built for them for free, and see if they want to work with us or not.
- At that point we would either delete the customer staged site if they choose not to, or promote it to "Customer" and then set up all their other stuff, at which point we'd need to transfer their site we built for them from our prospect subdomain to their domain name, still within Netlify. We offer all our customers hosting on our singular Netlify account.
- Then we would manage our customer accounts in bulk.

# Feature Requirements

### Website Management

- Ability to manage the ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù at the project level in the content area
- All pages are linked
- The project is ‚Äúdeployable/publishable‚Äù as a single website package that can be deployed on Netlify

### **Administrative Interface**

- **Accounts Dashboard/Page:** ‚úÖ Tabbed view (Prospects, Customer, Inactive) with lists of all accounts and corresponding available actions per list item
- **Project Dashboard/Page**: ‚úÖ Enhanced tabbed view (Draft, Templates, Active, Paused/Maintenance, Archive) with lists of all projects and corresponding available actions per list item
    - ‚úÖ Can filter by search term
    - ‚úÖ **Quick Actions**: Status change dropdown, view/edit, clone, deploy, archive, delete buttons
    - ‚úÖ **Bulk Selection**: Multi-project operations (bulk status change, archive, delete with confirmations)
    - ‚ùå **Deployment Controls**: One-click deployment with configuration (not yet implemented)

### **Template Management System**

- **Create Templates**: Convert any project to "Template-Internal" status
- **Template Library**: Browse and select from available templates
- **Template Deployment**: Auto-deploy "Template-Public" to niche subdomains
- **Template Versioning**: Track template updates and changes

### **Project Lifecycle Management**

- **Status Engine**: Automated actions based on project status
- **Status Transitions**: Controlled workflows between statuses
- **Deployment Automation**: Auto-deploy to appropriate environments
- **Domain Management**: Automated subdomain and custom domain setup

### **Account & Project Organization**

- **Account Creation**: New customer account setup
- **Project Assignment**: Assign projects to specific accounts
- **Data Isolation**: Enforce multi-tenant security
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass status changes and project management

### **Netlify Integration**

- **Subdomain Automation**: Auto-create prospect subdomains
- **Domain Migration**: Move from subdomain to custom domain
- **Maintenance Mode**: Deploy maintenance pages
- **Site Management**: Programmatic site creation/deletion
- **Deployment Queue System**: Handle 50+ simultaneous deployments with rate limiting
- **API Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm to stay under 500 calls/minute
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitor deployment progress and queue position

## Project Statuses & Actions

- **Draft:** This stays local to the admin application/database. Nothing should be deployed to Netlify.
- **Template-Internal:** This also stays local to the admin application/database. This is added to a table of ‚Äútemplates‚Äù that I can use and see when creating a new project.
- **Template-Public:** We will clone an internal template and make it live so customers can see it. This is deployed to Netlify on a staging subdomain for wondrousdigital.com. The naming schema for our templates and subdomains will be niche specific. So the ‚ÄúChiropractor-1‚Äù template will be on chiropractor-1.wondrousdigital.com
    - Our admin tools must be able to automate the process of creating the subdomain and pushing the template to the subdomain so it can be viewed live.
- **Prospect Staging:** We will have cloned an internal template, customized it a bit, and filled it with the prospects information and logo. This is then deployed to our Netlify on a staging subdomain for wondrousdigital.com. We will put it in the companies name like ‚Äúraleighchiropractors.wondrousdigital.com‚Äù and then it will be live to show the prospect and share it with them so they can see it.
- **Live Customer**: At this point, we promote the prospect website to live. This is where we will create customer accounts, and give them access to the platform where their website will be. They will be able to edit their pages and the content on them. We will need to MOVE their project in Netlify from our subdomain to their custom domain (on our account). We charge them for hosting, and part of our offering.
- **Pause/Maintenance**: This setting is admin facing only. We can set their website to paused/maintenance mode. Which will keep the domain on Netlify as is, but it will be a maintenance page with the customers contact information on it (we want to be classy and professional). This can be reinstated with a single setting change at anytime if the customer comes back to us or pays their bill.
- **Archived**: This is an ‚Äúinactive‚Äù but not deleted project status. This puts the project files into a folder, and the project shows up in the archived tab. At any point, we can resurrect it, set it to another status, which will then potentially redeploy it.
- **Delete**: This permanently deletes the project file from the admin app. It can not be reinstated, the files are deleted.

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Deployment Queue System Architecture**

#### Database Schema
- **deployment_queue**: Stores queued deployments with priority, status, and retry logic
- **deployment_logs**: Tracks build output and deployment progress
- Automatic cleanup of old deployments (30-day retention)

#### Core Services
1. **DeploymentQueueService** (`src/services/deploymentQueueService.ts`)
   - Queue deployment tasks
   - Track queue position
   - Real-time status updates via Supabase subscriptions
   - Cancel queued deployments

2. **NetlifyRateLimiter** (`src/services/netlifyRateLimiter.ts`)
   - Token bucket algorithm (450 tokens/minute)
   - Priority-based request queuing
   - Automatic token refill at 7.5 tokens/second
   - Reserve pool of 50 tokens for critical operations

3. **Supabase Edge Function** (`supabase/functions/process-deployment-queue/index.ts`)
   - Serverless function that runs every 2 minutes via cron
   - Processes up to 3 deployments concurrently
   - Handles all Netlify API interactions
   - Updates deployment status in real-time
   - Manages retries and error handling
   - Deployed and operational as of January 21, 2025

#### UI Components
1. **DeploymentStatusIndicator** - Real-time deployment tracking
2. **DeploymentQueueStatus** - Overall queue health monitoring
3. **Enhanced DeployProjectModal** - Queue-aware deployment interface

#### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Maximum 3 concurrent deployments
- API calls distributed across deployments
- Higher priority for re-deployments
- Automatic queueing when rate limit reached

### **Supabase Edge Function Architecture (COMPLETE - January 21, 2025)**

#### Edge Function Implementation
The deployment processing has been moved from the React client to a serverless Edge Function, providing:
- **Reliable Processing**: Cron-based execution ensures deployments are processed even if users close their browsers
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple deployments concurrently without blocking the UI
- **Cost Efficiency**: Serverless execution only runs when needed
- **Better Error Handling**: Centralized retry logic and error recovery

#### Deployment Flow
1. **User Action**: Click "Deploy Project" in React app
2. **Queue Entry**: DeploymentQueueService adds job to deployment_queue table
3. **Real-time Updates**: React app subscribes to deployment status changes
4. **Edge Function Processing**: 
   - Runs every 2 minutes via cron schedule
   - Fetches up to 3 queued deployments ordered by priority and creation time
   - Marks them as 'processing' to prevent duplicate processing
   - Creates/updates Netlify sites with proper subdomain configuration
   - Generates ZIP files from static HTML export
   - Uploads files to Netlify and monitors deployment
   - Updates deployment status and logs throughout the process
5. **Status Updates**: Edge Function updates deployment_queue with results
6. **User Feedback**: React app shows real-time progress via Supabase subscriptions

#### Edge Function Configuration
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: API token for Netlify operations
  - `NETLIFY_TEAM_ID`: Team identifier for site creation
  - `SUPABASE_URL` & `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Auto-provided by Supabase
- **Schedule**: Runs every 2 minutes (`*/2 * * * *`)
- **Concurrency**: Processes max 3 deployments per run to respect API limits
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Logging**: All operations logged to deployment_logs table for debugging
- **Deployment**: Live and operational on Supabase Edge Functions platform

#### React App Integration
1. **DeploymentQueueService**: Manages queue operations and subscriptions
2. **DeploymentStatusIndicator**: Shows real-time deployment progress
3. **DeploymentHistory**: Displays past deployments for each project
4. **Queue Position Updates**: Automatic polling while queued
5. **Subscription Cleanup**: Proper memory management on component unmount
